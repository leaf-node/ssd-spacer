ssd-spacer is designed with ImplicitCAD. It describes a spacer to place between
an SSD and the other side of a server's 3.5" hard drive bay caddy.

## Status

This project is in beta. The first prototype has not yet been printed or tested
in the real world. Measurements may be incorrect at this stage.

## Use

First you need to install ImplicitCAD or OpenSCAD. I recommend ImplicitCAD.

To generate an `.stl` file:

    $ extopenscad ssd-spacer.escad

You may then use the `.stl` file with your favorite slicer and 3d printer. You
can also view this file on your computer by importing it within blender.
